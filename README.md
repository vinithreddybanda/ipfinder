# 🧠 Domain-IP Checker (Mini GUI App)

> A basic GUI-based utility built using Python and Tkinter to fetch the IP address of a domain name. Originally created as a **mini project during my diploma**, this app was part of my early exploration into desktop interfaces and socket-level networking.

This tool was developed purely for learning and experimentation — to get hands-on experience with:

- GUI layout and interaction with **Tkinter**
- Using system-level data like **hostname/IP**
- Building small, functional apps with a clean UI
